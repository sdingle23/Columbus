            <article>
                Columbus was first designed in 1812 by of the Ohio State government, as the new state capital. That year groundbreaking efforts began to construct and start to build the city. It quickly began to grow with city lots being established and sold, to building of a penitentiary, school, church and a newspaper. Progress of Columbus was quickly moving ahead. In 1816 the capital was moved to Columbus, making it the new state capital. Based on its convenient location to major transportation routes, Columbus was becoming an economical and highly populated city.
