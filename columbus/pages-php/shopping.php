            <h3>Polaris Shopping Center</h3>
            <article>
              On my past trip to Columbus my family and I visited the many stores in the Polaris mall and were amazed. The variety of shops they have are mind boggling. Many of the shops are locally-owned and some are exclusive such as Ambercombie and Fitch, Aeropostale, and the Apple store to name a few. It is a huge mall with a nice mix of major and local stores to satisfy all shopping tastes. It also has entertainment and food offerings for tired shoppers to get a bite to eat (before round 2 of their shopping adventure). The hours are convenient also with a seven day a week operating hours, allowing for visitors to plan their shopping trips. I would highly recommend stopping by during your visit, you won’t be disappointed.

                      What would a trip to Columbus be without trying some delicious chocolate Buckeyes? At this wonderful chocolate shop, you can find some of the most delicious chocolate assortments for your sweet tooth’s.
