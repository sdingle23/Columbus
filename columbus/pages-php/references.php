                The construction of this website has been a very rewarding accomplishment. a great deal of hard work, thought and imagination was put in to bringing this website to life. Much like everything in life I could not have done it alone. Quite a bit of research was done in completing this project. Information was used from several different websites, along with images to visually enhance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the table below you will find details of information that was borrowed in order to complete this website. I give information of the website,when it was updated, what kinds of information was used(ex. image, information regarding the place, history, etc.). I cannot state enough that without assisted information from the references on this page, I would not have been able to complete this project. I want to ensure that all the individuals and sites that allowed me to create this website are recognized.
