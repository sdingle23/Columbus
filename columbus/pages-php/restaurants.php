            <h3>Milestones 229</h3>
            <article>
                For those of you just looking to dine out with friends or family in a casual setting, Milestones 229 might be right up your alley. Located in downtown Columbus this American fair is in the heart of the city. This casual dining spot was voted ‘Best New Restaurant’ by Columbus monthly in 2011. With its breathtaking view of the city’s skyline and riverfront, it is a great place to enjoy a delicious meal. The menu is chocked full of American fare such as, sandwiches, pizza, salads, and desserts, made from locally grown ingredients.  During my visit, I was fortunate enough to dine here and loved the 229 American Cheeseburger. I would highly recommend it for visitors that want a relaxing meal with a great view of the city.
