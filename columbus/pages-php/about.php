            <p class="about"> In the summer of 2016 he visited Columbus, Ohio for      a weekend getaway, and it quickly became his            favorite city. Amazed by all that the city has to offer, it inspired him to tell the world about his new favorite city Columbus, Ohio. His only regret is that the visit was shorter than he liked, and he was unable take pictures of the beautiful city.So he created this site to provide an overview of what makes this city a premier vacation destination. Hopefully after viewing this website it will become a favorite destination spot for you and your family.</p>
            <p class="about"> Sean enjoys creating websites such as this one, that is      informative, creative, and imaginative. He loves            hearing comments from visitors of his websites. If you      enjoyed this website about Columbus, send him an            email to let him know. </p>
