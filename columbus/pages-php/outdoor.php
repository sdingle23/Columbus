           The great outdoors provides a lot of activities and hours of enjoyment for people who like to be active in sports, nature, and just generally like to be outside in the fresh air. My recent trip to Ohio gave me several opportunities to experience the beautiful scenery and take in some of the outdoor recreation Columbus has to offer. My family and I took in some of the parks while on our visits. Parks are just the beginning of the outdoor offerings Columbus has to offer. Here are some examples of some of the outdoor activities to be had while visiting Columbus.

             What would a visit to Columbus be, without experiencing a game at The Ohio State “Horseshoe” stadium. If you find yourself in Columbus between August and December, then this is an outdoor activity you must partake in. My family and I have already put this on our bucket list for our next visit. The home of the 2014 National Champions, this experience will be like no other sporting event you have ever experienced. With recent renovations the stadium is state of the art, creating a lasting impression on any fan. It also holds concerts in the summer months, so no matter when your visit your experience will be one with a lasting memory.

               If sporting events are not your interest or you just want to enjoy nature, I would highly recommend Columbus Commons Park. It is a 6-acre, privately owned park that is beautiful and spacious. The lawns are well kept and green, it has a modern performance arts stage, two modern cafes, and an outdoor reading room. This park has everything for the outdoor enthusiasts. With more than 200 annual events each year, there is something for everyone. Let’s not forget the fitness buffs out there, it also home to free fitness classes. On our visit we took time out from our site-seeing to just sit in the park and enjoy nature. If you love the outdoors this is the perfect place for you, so why not give it a try.

                 If you enjoy the beauty and splendor of botanical gardens, Franklin Park Conservatory is a must see in your visit to Columbus. The residents rave about the wide variety of flowers and plants on this 13-acres in the Conservatory building. This is on my list on my next trip to Columbus. With many seasonal exhibits such as the Orchids, there is a great deal of beauty to be seen indoors and outdoors. With a 4-acre outdoor garden consisting of arose pavilion and 40 community gardens, you will be taken back by all the botanical beauty. So, if you love flowers and their beauty, this is a must visit in Columbus.
